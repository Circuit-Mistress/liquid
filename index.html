  <hr/>

  <p>Liquid is an extraction from the e-commerce system Shopify. Shopify powers many thousands of e-commerce stores which all call for unique designs. For this we developed Liquid which allows our customers complete design freedom while maintaining the integrity of our servers.</p>

  <p>Liquid has been in production use since June 2006 and is now used by many other hosted web applications.</p>

  <p>It was developed for usage in Ruby on Rails web applications and integrates seamlessly as a plugin but it also works excellently as a stand alone library.</p>
